- If you have a streak and your ball is on fire then it goes faster

Theme
Zoo - our tennis game will be set in a zoo
- Animal abuse
- Jumanji 


- A plan
For our idea we will be making a multiplayer tennis game, put our own images as the ball (zookeeper) and the two players - animals, a monkey and a bear. Our game will have a simple lobby with jungle music in the background. We will track points during the game. 

RULES: 
- Whoever gets the point gets to serve 
- If the ball goes out, opponent gets a point
- Getting a streak means sound change —> 15, 30, 40, 45, 60



3-5 moodboard images that have inspired your aesthetic approach. These should be original art work (although you can include some inspirational images from other media in addition to your original artwork)


- A list of the group members and a detailed account of their duties/role in the development of the project.
